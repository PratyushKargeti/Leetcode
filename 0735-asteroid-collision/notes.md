The given code implements a function called `asteroidCollision`, which takes a vector of integers representing asteroids' sizes and returns a new vector with the remaining asteroids after simulating their collisions.

Let's break down how the function works step by step:

1. Create an empty vector `res` to store the result of the asteroid collisions.

2. Loop through each asteroid in the input vector `asteroids` using a range-based for loop.

3. For each asteroid `a` in the loop, initialize a boolean variable `destroyed` as false. This variable will be used to track whether the current asteroid is destroyed or not.

4. Check for possible collisions with the asteroids already present in the `res` vector using a while loop. The loop runs as long as the following conditions are met:
   - The `res` vector is not empty (to ensure there are asteroids to collide with).
   - The last element in the `res` vector is positive (meaning it's moving towards the right) and the current asteroid `a` is negative (meaning it's moving towards the left).
   - The current asteroid has not been destroyed (`!destroyed`).

5. Inside the while loop, the program checks for two conditions:
   - If the absolute value of the last asteroid in `res` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the current asteroid `a`, it means the current asteroid `a` will be destroyed in the collision. So, set `destroyed` to true.
   - If the absolute value of the last asteroid in `res` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the current asteroid `a`, it means the last asteroid will be destroyed, and we remove it from the `res` vector using `res.pop_back()`.

6. After the while loop, check whether the current asteroid `a` was destroyed or not. If it was not destroyed, add it to the `res` vector using `res.push_back(a)`.

7. Continue the loop until all asteroids in the input vector have been processed.

8. Finally, return the resulting `res` vector, which contains the remaining asteroids after the collisions have been simulated.

In summary, the function processes the input vector of asteroids, simulating their collisions, and returns a new vector containing the asteroids that remain after all possible collisions have been resolved.
