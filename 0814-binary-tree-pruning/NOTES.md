â€‹The first way of implementing the code is incorrect because it deletes the node using `delete root` when pruning a subtree. This causes a runtime error because it leads to a heap-use-after-free issue. Once the node is deleted, the memory associated with it is deallocated, and any further access to that memory results in undefined behavior.

The correct approach, as shown in the second implementation, is to simply set the left and right pointers of the nodes that need to be pruned to `nullptr`. This approach avoids deleting the nodes and instead modifies the structure of the tree.

Here's a summary of the differences between the two approaches:

First Way:
1. Deletes the node when pruning a subtree using `delete root`.
2. Leads to a runtime error due to a heap-use-after-free issue.

Second Way (Correct):
1. Sets the left and right pointers of the nodes to be pruned to `nullptr`.
2. Avoids deleting the nodes and modifies the structure of the tree.
3. Does not result in a runtime error.

In conclusion, the second way is the correct and recommended approach for solving the "Binary Tree Pruning" problem to avoid runtime errors.

doubt1:
Once the node is deleted, the memory associated with it is deallocated, and any further access to that memory results in undefined behavior. YOU SAID "to that memory" but I was just returning a NULL after delete root ..how it is known that i was accessing deleted memory?

answer:
In the first implementation, when you use `delete root`, you are deallocating the memory associated with that node and returning `NULL` afterward. This action makes the pointer `root` point to a memory location that has been deallocated, which leads to undefined behavior if any further access is attempted on that memory location.

Even though you are returning `NULL` after deleting `root`, the pointer returned by the `postorder` function is still pointing to the same memory address that was deallocated. Therefore, if any other part of the code tries to access that memory using the returned pointer, it becomes a case of "use-after-free," which is undefined behavior and can cause runtime errors like the heap-use-after-free error you encountered.

In contrast, the correct implementation (the second way) sets the left and right pointers to `nullptr` instead of deleting the node. This way, the node remains in memory, but its left and right subtrees are effectively pruned. The memory is not deallocated prematurely, and there is no risk of accessing freed memory, avoiding the runtime error.

So, it's essential to avoid using `delete` unless you are sure that no other part of the code will attempt to access the same memory location after the deletion. In this case, setting the pointers to `nullptr` is the safer approach and avoids the issues of accessing deleted memory.
