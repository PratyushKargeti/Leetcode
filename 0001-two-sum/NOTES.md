This is a C++ implementation of the two-sum problem using a hash map (unordered map) for efficient lookup. The goal of the two-sum problem is to find two numbers in the given `nums` array that add up to the given `target`.

 Breakdown :

1. It defines a class named `Solution` that contains a public member function `twoSum` which takes a vector of integers `nums` and an integer `target` as parameters.

2. The commented-out code at the beginning of the function uses nested loops to check all possible pairs of numbers in the `nums` array. It compares the sum of each pair with the target and returns the indices if a pair is found. If no pair is found, it returns {-1, -1}. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the size of the `nums` array.

3. Instead of the nested loops, the code utilizes an unordered map `m` to solve the problem more efficiently.

4. It iterates through the `nums` array using a for loop and maintains an index `i`.

5. Inside the loop, it calculates the complement of the current number by subtracting it from the `target` variable. The complement represents the value that, when added to the current number, gives the target sum.

6. It checks if the complement exists in the map by using the `count` function. If `m.count(complement) > 0`, it means the complement is present in the map.

7. If the complement is found in the map, it means we have found a pair that adds up to the target sum. It returns the indices {i, m[complement]}, where `i` is the current index, and `m[complement]` represents the index of the complement.

8. If the complement is not found in the map, it means the current number has not been encountered before. In this case, it adds the current number and its index to the map using `m[nums[i]] = i`.

9. After the loop finishes, if no pair is found, it returns {-1, -1}.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the `nums` array since the unordered map allows constant time average-case lookups. It provides an efficient solution to the two-sum problem.â€‹
