The given code is an implementation of the Sudoku-solving algorithm using a backtracking approach. 
It solves the Sudoku puzzle represented by a 9x9 grid using a recursive function called solve.

Let's go through the code step by step:

The issafe function checks if it is safe to place the character ch at position (i, j) on the Sudoku board.
It checks three conditions:

No other cell in the same row contains the same character ch.
No other cell in the same column contains the same character ch.
No other cell in the same 3x3 subgrid contains the same character ch.
If any of these conditions are violated, the function returns false, indicating that it is not safe to place the character. Otherwise, it returns true.

The solve function is the main recursive function that solves the Sudoku puzzle.
It iterates through each cell of the board and checks if it is empty (represented by '.').
If an empty cell is found, it tries to place a digit from 1 to 9 in that cell using a loop.

It calls the issafe function to check if it is safe to place the digit in the current cell.
If it is safe, it places the digit in the current cell, updates the board, and makes a recursive call to solve to continue solving the rest of the board.
If the recursive call returns true, it means the puzzle has been successfully solved, so it returns true.
If the recursive call returns false, it means the current digit placement leads to an invalid solution,
so it backtracks by resetting the current cell to '.' and tries the next digit.

Let's break down the code block to understand its flow:

The if(board[i][j]=='.') condition checks if the current cell is empty (represented by '.').

If the cell is empty, it enters the for loop, which iterates over the digits from '1' to '9' and tries to place each digit in the current cell.

Inside the for loop, the if(issafe(i,j,board,ch)) condition checks if it is safe to place the digit ch in the current cell. 
If it is safe, the digit is placed in the cell (board[i][j] = ch), and the solve function is recursively called to continue solving the rest of the board.

If the recursive call to solve(board) returns true, it means a valid solution has been found, so the return true; statement is reached, and
the solution is propagated up the call stack.

If the recursive call to solve(board) returns false, it means that the current digit placement did not lead to a valid solution. 
In this case, the algorithm backtracks by resetting the current cell to '.' (undoing the previous placement) and continues to the 
next digit in the for loop to explore other possibilities.

If none of the digits in the for loop lead to a valid solution, the return false; statement is reached after the loop ends. 
This indicates that the current partial placement of digits does not lead to a valid solution. 
The algorithm will propagate this information up the call stack, triggering backtracking at previous recursive levels until a 
valid solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.

In summary, the return false; statement at the end of the code block is reached when all digit placements in the current 
cell have been tried and none of them lead to a valid solution. It signals to the previous recursive call that the current 
path is invalid, and the algorithm needs to backtrack and explore other possibilities.
