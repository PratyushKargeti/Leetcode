1. `bool issafe(int currRow, vector<int>& col)`: This function determines whether it is safe to place a queen at the current position
(`currRow`, `col[currRow]`) on the chessboard. It takes the current row `currRow` and a reference to the `col` vector as parameters. 
The `col` vector represents the column positions of the queens placed so far.

   - The function iterates over the previously placed queens (from row 0 to `currRow - 1`).
   - For each previously placed queen, it checks if there is a conflict with the current queen based on two conditions:
  - `col[currRow] == col[row]`: If the current queen and the previously placed queen share the same column, it indicates a conflict.
  - `abs(col[currRow] - col[row]) == currRow - row`: If the absolute difference between the column positions of the current and previously placed queens 
        is equal to the difference in their row positions, it indicates a conflict.
   - If either of these conditions is true for any previously placed queen, the function returns `false`, indicating that the current position is not safe.
   - If no conflicts are found, the function returns `true`, indicating that it is safe to place a queen at the current position.

2. `void place(int i, int n, vector<int>& col, vector<string>& board, vector<vector<string>>& ans)`: This function is a helper function for solving
the N-Queens problem using backtracking. It takes the current row `i`, the board size `n`, references to the `col` and `board` vectors, and a reference to
the `ans` vector (which stores the solutions).

   - The purpose of this function is to recursively explore all possible valid placements of queens on the chessboard and record the solutions in the `ans` vector.
   - The function uses a depth-first search approach with backtracking.
   - If the current row `i` is equal to `n`, it means all rows have been filled with queens, and a valid solution is found.
     - In this case, the current board configuration (`board`) is added to the `ans` vector using `ans.push_back(board)`.
     - The function then returns to explore other possibilities.
   - If the current row `i` is less than `n`, the function proceeds to the next row and tries placing a queen in each column of the current 
row (`board[i][j]`) using a loop.
     - For each column position `j`, it assigns the current column position `j` to `col[i]` to keep track of the queen's position in the current row.
     - It checks if placing a queen at the current position is safe by calling the `issafe` function. If it is safe, the function proceeds.
       - It updates the `board` by placing a queen at the current position (`board[i][j] = 'Q'`).
       - It makes a recursive call to the `place` function with the next row (`i + 1`) to explore the placements in the subsequent row.
       - After the recursive call returns, it backtracks by removing the queen from the current position (`board[i][j] = '.'`).
     - The loop continues to explore other column positions, repeating the process for each position in the current row.
   - By exploring all possibilities, the function eventually finds all valid solutions and stores them in the `ans` vector.

3. `vector<vector<string>> solveNQueens(int n)`: This is the main function that solves the N-Queens problem. It takes the

 board size `n` as a parameter and returns a vector of vectors (`vector<vector<string>>`) representing the solutions.

   - Inside the function:
     - It initializes the `col` vector with `n` elements, representing the column positions of the queens in each row.
     - It initializes the `board` vector with `n` strings, each of length `n`, and fills them with '.' characters to represent empty cells on the chessboard.
     - It initializes the `ans` vector, which will store the solutions.
     - It calls the `place` function with the initial row `i = 0`, passing the `col`, `board`, and `ans` vectors as parameters.
     - After the backtracking process is completed, the `ans` vector contains all valid solutions.
     - Finally, the function returns the `ans` vector containing the solutions to the N-Queens problem.

In summary, the `issafe` function checks whether it is safe to place a queen at the current position by checking for conflicts with previously 
placed queens. The `place` function recursively explores all possible placements and records valid solutions using backtracking. The `solveNQueens` 
function initializes the necessary data structures and calls the `place` function to solve the N-Queens problem.

if queen is placed at current position and later on removed, then how this code this ans as a board filled with some queens as required?

In the provided code, the backtracking process is used to explore all possible placements of queens on the chessboard. When a valid placement
is found, the code marks the corresponding cell on the board as 'Q' to represent a queen. However, after exploring that particular placement and
backtracking, the code resets the cell back to '.' to remove the queen from that position.

The reason for removing the queen from the board during backtracking is to ensure that all possible configurations are explored. 
By resetting the cell to '.', the code can try different placements for the current row in subsequent iterations of the loop. 
This process continues until all possible configurations have been explored, and the code records valid solutions by adding the board configurations to the ans vector.
Therefore, at the end of the execution, the ans vector will contain all valid solutions to the N-Queens problem, where each solution represents a
board configuration with queens placed according to the problem constraints.

Again,In the base case, the current board configuration (board) is added to the ans vector as a valid solution.
Otherwise, for each column j in the current row i, the code tries to place a queen at position (i, j):
It sets the j-th element of the col vector to j, indicating that a queen is placed at column j of row i.
It checks if it is safe to place a queen at the current position using the issafe function.
If it is safe, it marks the corresponding cell on the board as 'Q' to represent the queen.
It recursively calls the place function with the next row i + 1.
After the recursive call returns, the code resets the cell back to '.' to remove the queen from that position.
After exploring all possible placements and backtracking, the ans vector will contain all valid solutions.

After the recursive call returns, the code reaches the backtracking step. It resets the cell in board back to '.' 
(empty cell) to remove the queen from the previous position. This allows the function to backtrack and explore other possible placements.

The function continues the iteration over the column positions for the current row and repeats the process until all possibilities have been explored.
In the context of the N-Queens problem, "other possible placements" refer to different valid positions where a queen can be placed on the chessboard. The algorithm systematically explores these positions by backtracking.

Here's how the exploration process works:

1. The algorithm starts with an empty chessboard and attempts to place a queen in the first row (row 0) at each column position 

(0 to n-1), where n is the size of the chessboard (number of rows/columns).

2. For each column position in the first row, the algorithm checks if it is safe to place a queen at that position by calling the `issafe` 
function. If it is safe, the algorithm marks that cell as a queen ('Q') in the `board` vector and moves on to the next row (row 1).

3. In the next row, the algorithm again tries to place a queen at each column position, considering only the valid positions based on the constraints of
the N-Queens problem. This process continues row by row until all rows have been processed.

4. If at any point the algorithm finds that a queen cannot be placed in a specific row/column position without violating the constraints, it 
backtracks to the previous row and explores other possible positions for the queen in that row.

5. This backtracking process continues until all possible configurations have been explored, and the algorithm has either found all valid solutions 
or exhausted all possibilities.




During the backtracking process, when the algorithm determines that a queen cannot be placed in a specific row/column position without
violating the constraints, it backtracks to the previous row. At this point, the algorithm resets the cell in the `board` vector back to '.' 
(empty cell) to remove the queen from that position.

By resetting the cell back to '.', the algorithm effectively undoes the previous queen placement and creates an opportunity to explore other 
possible positions for the queen in that row. It allows the algorithm to backtrack and try alternative placements for the queen in the previous row.

The backtracking mechanism, combined with resetting the cell to '.', enables the algorithm to systematically explore different combinations of 
queen placements on the chessboard until it finds all valid solutions. It allows the algorithm to try different possibilities, backtrack when necessary, 
and continue exploring other potential placements.

So, the "other possible placements" refer to the different valid positions where a queen can be placed on the chessboard in each row, and the 
algorithm explores these positions iteratively through recursive calls and backtracking until it finds all valid solutions to the N-Queens problem.
